Deicing procedures
""""""""""""""""""
Before taxi, and when the temperature is above M10 but below 3 and dewpoint is below 2, the apron controller will ask all aircraft whether they require Deicing to occur. Should this be needed, the controller will taxi the aircraft to hold short of stand 26. This is at the discretion of the captain of the aircraft.

Airport Construction
""""""""""""""""""""
At present; & until 31st may 2017 WIP is occurring on taxiways A & B. As a result, these are closed. All aircraft are required to backtrack the runway using the small area at the end.
