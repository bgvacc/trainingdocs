Deicing procedures
""""""""""""""""""
Deicing occurs on stand

Departure procedures
""""""""""""""""""""
Maximum climb gradient is in force on all departure routes to 12000ft QNH.

Procedural approach
"""""""""""""""""""
Gorna tower provides procedural approach services to aircraft within the Gorna CTR. No radar is available within this area.

ATIS
""""
Gorna ATIS is availble only when LBGO_TWR is online

Parking positions
"""""""""""""""""

Due to the small apron size, during periods of high traffic this may become full. As a result, the two options available are tohold aircraft overhead the Gorna VOR or park aircraft to the south of the runway on the grass. This is at the discretion of the situation coordinator and tower.
