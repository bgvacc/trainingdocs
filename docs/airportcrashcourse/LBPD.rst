Deicing procedures
""""""""""""""""""
Before taxi, and when the temperature is above M10 but below 3 and dewpoint is below 2, the apron controller will ask all aircraft whether they require Deicing to occur. Should this be needed, the controller will taxi the aircraft to hold short of the deicing area on the south entry. The aircraft is then cleared for deicing, and should taxi to the north exit upon completion of the deicing. this is at the discretion of the captain of the aircraft.

Night procedures
""""""""""""""""
For noise abatement reasons, from 200-0400 Landing on runway 12 is forbidden as well as takeoff from 30. Use of reverse thrust is also restricted. 

Departure procedures
""""""""""""""""""""
Aircraft with a MTOW of 5.7t or greater shall commence takeoff run as far southeast as possible. Minimum climb gradient is in force on all departure routes.

Procedural approach
"""""""""""""""""""
Plovdiv tower provides procedural approach services to aircraft within the Plovdiv CTR. No radar is available within this area.

ATIS
""""
Plovdiv does not have an ATIS
