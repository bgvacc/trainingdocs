Deicing procedures
""""""""""""""""""
Before taxi, and when the temperature is above M10 but below 3 and dewpoint is below 2, the apron controller will ask all aircraft whether they require Deicing to occur. Should this be needed, the controller will taxi the aircraft to hold short of the deicing area on the south entry. The aircraft is then cleared for deicing, and should taxi to the north exit upon completion of the deicing. this is at the discretion of the captain of the aircraft.
